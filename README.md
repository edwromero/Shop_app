# shop_app


Today I bring you a little more of what I am developing in flutter.

In this practice I made an interface of a shop app! connected with Firebase. It's fully functional and you can get my code on github and check it out. You only need a basic configuration and you will shoot the project without much problem.

  *Characteristics of what is applied in the video:*
* Login screen, with registration included in the database.
* Transition animations.
* Differentiation between admin user and common user.
* Added shopping cart.
* Order screen.
* New product display.
* Logout button.
* Auto Logout via token.
* Automatic login validation through token.
* Basic form for product registration.
* Addition of favorites button and favorites screen.
* Treatment of errors in general, both for screens for registration of products and login. 
Contains the general exceptions of any application. (exception @, very short password, without .com, etc).
* Slider to delete product. Alert to undo product added in the cart (bottom of the application)

#This video shows that when you enter with another user than admin, you do not get access to the products for editing and since you are a new user. You have no set order.

#Here we see the error handling in general, the list of favorites and the expiration of the start token (preconfigured especially for the demo).
